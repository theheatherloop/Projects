# HTML and CSS Projects

Some simple websites that I made using HTML and CSS.

## Projects

- Final Fantasy IX Site
- Movie Theater Site
- Personal Portfolio

### Final Fantasy IX Site

This page is an example home page for the video game, Final Fantasy 9. It's styled using CSS and features a navbar, image containers, and a form.

### Movie Theater Site

This page is an example home page for a movie theater that is styled using Bootstrap 4. It features many Bootstrap components like a navar, jumbotron, form, cards, and dropdowns.

### Personal Portfolio

This is the start of my online portfolio. It's styled using CSS.
