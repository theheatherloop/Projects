## Projects
- Icosahedron Roll 
<br/>

### Icosahedron Roll
>This allows users to input names for "Player 1" and "Player 2." It simulates a game where both players roll a 20-sided die, with the program storing the results and identifying any critical outcomes, such as "Critical Failure" for a roll of 1 and "Critical Success" for a roll of 20. >After rolling, the program compares the two rolls, displays the results along with any critical outcomes, and announces the winner based on the highest roll. >In case of a tie, it declares the players as "Evenly Matched," providing an engaging and competitive gaming experience.
